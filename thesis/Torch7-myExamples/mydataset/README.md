<h3> Training a CNN over our personal dataset </h3> 
We're working on a real-time project using a 3D-camera for helping blind people in avoiding obstacles.
In order to do this, we're getting our dataset for street objects recognition. 
Sooner I'll push all the scripts for labeling, modeling, training and testing the Net and a complete overview of the project.
