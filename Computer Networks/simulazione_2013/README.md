C: C/S application. There's 1 server process that is always listening and 2 client: 1 tcp and 1 udp. It's all about file/data transfer. N.B. This code sucks, it uses even the dangerous gets() function. But it was just some example for working with sockets and the professor himself did not even care about it.
