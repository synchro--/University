This is one of many exercises to prepare for exam. 
Simply:

<ol> 
<li>C: C/S application. There's 1 server process that is always listening and 2 client: 1 tcp and 1 udp. It's all about file/data transfer. 
N.B. This code sucks, it uses even the dangerous gets() and deprecated getHostByName() function. But it was just some example for working with sockets and sadly, the professor himself did not even care about it.
</li>
<li>Java: It is about the same thing but it is performed using Remoth Method Invocation (RMI). 
      The client make a lookupCall to the RMIregistry and receive the stub for invoking the remote methods. </li> 
</ol>
