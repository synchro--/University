\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces Tensor Decompositions for speeding up a generalized convolution. Each box correspond to a feature map stack within a CNN, (frontal sides are spatial dimensions). Arrows show linear mappings and demonstrate how scalar values on the right are computed. Initial full convolution (A) computes each element of the target tensor as a linear combination of the elements of a 3D subtensor that spans a spatial d \IeC {\texttimes } d window over all input maps. Jaderberg et al. (B) approximate the initial convolution as a composition of two linear mappings in which the intermediate mpa stack has R maps, being R the rank of the decomposition. Each of the two-components computes each target value with a convolution based on a spatial window of size dx1 or 1xd in all input maps. Finally, CP-decomposition (C) by Lebedev et al. approximates the convolution as a composition of four smaller convolutions: the first and the last components compute a standard 1x1 convolution that spans all input maps while the middle ones compute a 1D grouped convolution \textbf {only on one} input map. Each box is mathematically described in equation (\ref {eq:cpd1}-\ref {eq:cpd2})\relax }}{11}{figure.caption.66}
